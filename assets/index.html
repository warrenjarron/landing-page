                The Instagram app is loaded with all sorts of features these days, one of which is the ability to send direct messages to friends and family members. Thanks to a new update that's rolling out, it'll now be easier to get in touch with friends right away.

                AroundMe is testing out a question-asking feature in Stories
            </h2>
            <p class="text-white">
                Stories are a great way to get feedback from your followers. With the poll sticker and emoji slider sticker, users can find out what their fans really think about...well, anything! I've seen individuals ask their followers for opinions about which of two haircuts to get, which of two product color schemes to go forward with, and even how much they loved the finale of [insert preferred TV show here].
